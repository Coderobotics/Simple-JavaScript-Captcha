Captcha is used to prevent bots from automatically submitting forms with SPAM or other unwanted content. Javascript Captcha will help us to stop spamming leads or content submissions through the forms. Client-side captcha is important to prevent the server from responding to requests that are made by non-humans. Our free Javascript-based Captcha code works well for HTML-based forms, even you can have HTML code on WP forms, both work well. When you form to submit without captcha, then the script through the error to ask for entering the captcha that is shown on the screen.
